# üéØ Learn RAG with Prompts

## üìö Project Summary
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Mistral LLM for local document processing and question answering. The system:
- Processes uploaded documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX)
- Creates semantic embeddings
- Stores in vector database
- Retrieves relevant context
- Generates accurate answers using Mistral
- Provides user-friendly Streamlit interface
